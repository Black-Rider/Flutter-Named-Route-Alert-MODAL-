A  Flutter application.
That explains how does the Navigation works in Flutter
Keeping in mind that navigator in flutter uses stack so pages are stacked upon each.
Navigator uses push function in order to push a page
Navigator also has a pop function which get You Back to the Home Page.
In this particular setup I have used to demonstrate how to send data dynamically using Map a generic data type.
Map is a generic data type and can hold multiple keys and their values.


Pages Attached are From Pages folder and lib
Pubsec. Yaml is not attached.
this is simple design that I have used one can create very interactive design.
<h1>Nav Drawer and Tabs</h1>
<h2>Nav Drawer</h2>
<p>Nav Drawer we give option of Manging product and direct that on tap to Route towards products_admin.dart</p>
<p>Then from there we add the drawer in the Product admin page because we want to Create Tabs there</p>

<h2>Tabs</h2>
<p>We add two tabs and  direct them using TabBarView towards corresponding pages</p>
